# Image-Processor-For-Text-Extraction
Aim : The Aim of the project is to develop a image processor whose output could be used by neural networks for text extraction from the input image.<br />
Input : Image with single black text paragraph on white background as shown in [sample image](sample_image.jpg)<br />
Output : *Bounding rectange* of each charactor in the input. But for representation purpose the output is an binary image with every charactor highlighted by enclosing it in a white rectangle.<br />

Pre-requisites :<br />
	Python - Basic syntax, functions:str(),  and *handling command line arguments in python*<br />
	OpenCV - <br />
