# Image-Processor-For-Text-Extraction
<b>Aim</b> : The Aim of the project is to develop a image processor whose output could be used by neural networks for text extraction from the input image.<br />
<b>Input</b> : Image with single black text paragraph on white background as shown in [sample](sample_image.jpg)<br />
<b>Output</b> : Bounding rectangle of each character in the input. But for representation purpose the [output](output.jpg) is an binary image with every character highlighted by enclosing it in a white rectangle.<br /><br />
<b>Pre-requisites</b> :<br />
	<b>Modules</b> - cv2, numpy and sys (<i>you can download these using [pip](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/)</i>)<br />
	<b>Python</b> - Basic syntax, functions :str(), len(), range(), sum() (<i>you can read about these functions [here](https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/functions.html)</i>) and [handling command line arguments in python](http://www.pythonforbeginners.com/argv/more-fun-with-sys-argv).<br />
	<b>OpenCV</b> - imread(), dilate(), findContours(), contourArea(), Canny(), adaptiveThreshold(), erode(), bitwise_and(), minAreaRect(), getRotationMatrix2D(), warpAffine(), rectangle(), resize(), imwrite(), waitKey() and destroyAllWindows() (<i>you can read about these functions [here](https://docs.opencv.org/3.1.0/d2/d96/tutorial_py_table_of_contents_imgproc.html)</i>)<br />
	<b>Numpy</b> - ones(), where(), column_stack() (<i>you can read about these functions [here](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.14.0/genindex.html)</i>)<br /><br />
<b>Brief algorithm</b>:<br />
1)Read the input image in Grayscale format.<br />
2)Converted the image to binary format.<br />
3)Cropped the image to minimize non-text region.<br />
4)Removed any tilt from the text.<br />
5)Determined the y-indices of the top and the bottom of each line of text (<i>line segmentation</i>).<br />
6)In each line determined the x-indices of the beginning and the end of each character (<i>character segmentation</i>).<br />
7)The bounding rectangle of each character is found by its x-indices and the y-indices of the line containing the character.<br /><br />
<b>Result</b> - The bounding rectangle of each character could be fed to a neural network to covert the charctor from optical to text format.<br /></ br>

<b>Note</b> - People having the required knowledge of Neural Networks are most invited to work together on a complete optical charactor recognition system. Interested developers can contact manthanchauhan913@gmail.com.</ br>
