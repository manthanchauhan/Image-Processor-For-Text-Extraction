# Image-Processor-For-Text-Extraction
Aim : The Aim of the project is to develop a image processor whose output could be used by neural networks for text extraction from the input image.
Input : Image with single black text paragraph on white background as shown in [sample image]{sample_image.jpg}
Output : *Bounding rectange* of each charactor in the input. But for representation purpose the output is an binary image with every charactor highlighted by enclosing it in a white rectangle.

Pre-requisites :
	Python - Basic syntax, functions:str(),  and *handling command line arguments in python*
	OpenCV -
