# Image-Processor-For-Text-Extraction
Aim : The Aim of the project is to develop a image processor whose output could be used by neural networks for text extraction from the input image.<br />
Input : Image with single black text paragraph on white background as shown in [sample image](sample_image.jpg0<br />
Output : Bounding rectange of each charactor in the input. But for representation purpose the [output](output.jpg) is an binary image with every charactor highlighted by enclosing it in a white rectangle.<br /><br />
